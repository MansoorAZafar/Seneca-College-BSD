    Approach 1:
      -> Create a list called res
      -> loop from [0, n), n is non-inclusive
      -> add into the list the current value of i times 2
      -> return the resulting list
      -> run a loop for the values returned from the list with the argument of 5
      -> print the value in format of [value] ' : ' ...

    Approach 2:
      -> for every value in range of [0, 5) multiply it by 2
      -> for every value in the list comprehension listed above, print it
      -> Print in the format of [value] ' : ' ...

    Approach 3:
      -> define a function called doubleG with the parameter of n
      -> for the range of [0, n) (n not included)
      -> return the value of i * 2 from a generator object
      -> This function now with the key 'yield' is a generator

      -> loop for every value in the generator
        -> The generator only has the value from its own
        -> loop of [0, 5]
        -> So it will only 'generate' the values when called
      -> print it with format [value], ' : ' ...f
      -> Call the doubleG function again 
      [inside doubleG]:
        -> Increment i 
        -> yield next result
     -> repeat loop

2.
    What type of function is doubleG?
      -> doubleG is a generator function which means, it will 'generate' or get the first result of the loop inside itself, and will wait for a function to call it before continuing the iterations
      
    Advantages?
        -> maintain its own local state
        -> generates the remaining values ONLY when needed
        -> pause and resume execution
        -> Do not need to return lists
