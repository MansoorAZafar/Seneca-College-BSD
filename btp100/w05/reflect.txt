1)

The two possible selection constructs that could've been used to map the month integer to the first 3 letters
of the month would have been done with either a if statement or a case statement.
if(month == 11){
printf("NOV");
}else if(month == 12){
printf("DEC");
}
Or
case(month){
case 11: printf("Nov"); break;
case 12: printf("Dec"); break;
}

2)

The three types of iteration constructs are for, while and do-while loops. The one I used for validation of the values
was the while loop. I chose the while loop since I didn't want to run the method first rather I wanted the condition
to be checked first. This is since the while loop wouldn't have to run if the value was already valid.

3)

What I did to test and debug my program was first black box tests. If the code had any syntactic errors, visual
studio would point them out and show where the error was. While for semantic errors, I would run the program and
note at what section the program shows the wrong output. Upon finding where in the test run the issue lies in,
I would refer back to my code and look at the section which deals with the specific part.
