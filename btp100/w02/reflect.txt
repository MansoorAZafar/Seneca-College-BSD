1) Briefly explain why the cents2 variable doesn't properly represent the total cents of price2

The reason the cents2 variable cannot properly output the correct value of price2 is due to the fact that floating
points cannot store the excat values rather appromixate the value. In this case, the value is appromoixated
to ~10.119 it isn't actually valued at 10.12 so the integer value ends up returning 1011 since the 9 isn't rounded.
Let N repersent the number for the price. The fix to this, would be to simly add rounding to the equation 
within the brackets of (priceN * 100). So the final equation would be (priceN * 100 + 0.5); 

2)  demonstrate how the $20 denomination would be calculated

example: total cost = 135.65 (converted to an int in my program so 13565)
coins = totalCost; // coins = 13565
numOfTwenty = coins / 2000;
balanceOfTwenty = (int)((total % 2000) + 0.5);

The reason I would be using this code for my program is due to how I made the program run. I started off by
converting the total cost into a full integer. So if the cost was 135.65$ it would've been converted to 13565.
This results in the price being in pennies instead of dollars. Afterwords, I would then calculate the number of
twenty dollars by deviding the total cost as a full int by the number of pennies needed to make 20$, so in this case
2000 pennies are needed to make 20$. Finally, I would calculate the balance by similarly modulating the total
by 2000 and add 0.5 to round.

3) show three different ways to display the total cents as dollars + cents
*******
Casting:
int coins = 7245;
double total;

total = (double)coins / 100;
printf("The total is %.2lf:", total);

*********
Promotion:
int coins = 7245;
double total;

total = coins; total = total / 100;
printf("The total is %.2lf:", total);

**********
Narrowing
double coins = 72.45;
int total;

total = coins * 100;
printf("The total is %.2lf:", (float)total / 100);
