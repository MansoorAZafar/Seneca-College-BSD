1) What have you learned in completing this workshop (do not leave anything out!)

Through the completation of the first workshop, I have learned how to use newline (\n), tabs (\t), printf and the creation of the structure for the main function.
This first workshop asked us to print out both expressions/quotes, unique symbols and tabs. In order to complete this, I had to utilize the escape sequences 
such as new line, tab, backslash or even the % sign in order to create the desired outcome. Alongside this, this also allowed for me to understand how to format 
the main function. I had learned to use "void" as the parameters and precede the main with "int" in order for the program to run without any warning appearing.

2) Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop

Secured Socket Shell (SSH), is a program used to connect with the servers of linux for example, in this instance, we connected with the Seneca server through
the "matrix" using the program PuTTy. This was used to not only connect to the "matrix" but mainly used to both test my code and submit my code.

3) Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop

Secured File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), is a program used for transferring files, acessing files and slight altering for files. I had utilized WinSCP in this instance
in order to transfer my source code file from my deivce to the "matrix". Alongside this, I had also used it to view the proper end result, slightly alter my code file
and test my program.
