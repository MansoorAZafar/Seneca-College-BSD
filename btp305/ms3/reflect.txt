Thank you so much for the great semester, your teaching was always effective and you were amazing so thank you so much. 
The only feedback I really have is I would've really enjoyed making the 'main' file or having the 'main' file do less and allow 
us to build the connections between functions. For instance, instead of directly initalizing the LineManager, It would've been
easier to understand its purpose and use case if we were the ones populating it and dealing with the interactions. Thank you so much
for this semester.
