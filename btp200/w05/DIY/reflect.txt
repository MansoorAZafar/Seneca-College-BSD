	Throughout this workshop (workshop 05), I have learned the different usages and interactions of the different types of
operators. Firstly, I learned of the differnet operators being types, unary, binary and helpers alongside overloading them. For the 
DIY section, there exists a part where a variable b3 is able to be selected as the bool int or double operator and to prevent that
you just had to make the bool and double operator explicit so b3 wouldn't have the choice of being automatically set to them.
Secondly, the Unary operators I learned had two parts, a prefix and a postfix. The main difference being that a postfix has the datatype
int in their parameter whilst the prefix has nothing. Thirdly, I learned about the Binary operators. We used the = += and == operations 
to set a value equal to another, add ontop of an old value and check if equal with the binary operations. Then, we used the helper binary operators
mainly being the operator+. It was used to get the total value of a set amount without being from the class. I leanred that the helper operators
aren't placed inside rather outside the scope of the class. Also, I learned about the syntax of how to use the operators and how to call each of the
operators without needing to use an arrow or . to call the respective function. Finally, the issue I had encountered the largest amount of difficulty in
is the type operator overloadings. I had gotten help from my Professor, Dr Cornel, and he helped me understand when and how to use explicit and
when to not use it.
