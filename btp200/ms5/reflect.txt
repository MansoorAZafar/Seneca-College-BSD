I felt as if the milestones as a whole were fine. None of them took too much time and weren't that difficult to understand but the only feedback I would have to give
is just a nitpick but for submitting milestone 5 parts 1-5 the output should also include what we need to type. In milestones 1-4 they all have the text that we
need to type so we don't have to look back at the correct_output.txt but can just stay on the code. I.E
