	Throughout this workshop (workshop 04), I have learned the different usages and interactions of constructors and destructors in c++. Firstly, I had seen the usage,
creation and overload of a constructor. For example, from the lab section of this workshop, we had to create a constructor and an overloaded constructor for both the SoccerTeam
and Tournenments class's respectively. Our first constrcutor always had no parameters and so would act as a setEmpty function meaning, it would set the default values of the
class to an base state if called upon. In our DIY section, we had to call upon the the default constructor and so I learned that to call a default constructor you simply just had
to have the identifer of the class followed by the name and just an empty pair of curly brackets ({}). Ontop of this, I had learned how to properly use and overload the constructor
since we were required to do so in the workshop. Within the overloaded constructor rather, than setting all the values I realized that you can simply just call upon the other
functions used to set relative data. Secondly, I learned of destructors. Unlike the constructor, destructors I learned cannot be overloaded and are simply used to 'delete' and
clear out any excess memory/data. I would also like to mention, this is also the part that I had encountered the most difficulty in was trying to figure out how to set 
the character arrays to certain name lengths and not having the buffer contain extra information. I solved this issue by using the getchar() function by reading all the 
buffer but only storing up to 40 characters for the name.
